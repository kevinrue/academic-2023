Set up the main Git repository This Git repository is the one repository that I provide to the next group of participants to the course. It is intended as a read-only repository that participants are asked to clone, and where they’ll fetch the files to re-create the R environment that I prepared for them.\n In RStudio, create a new project  Use git Use renv    Edit the .gitignore file. Add the following lines.  solutions.R data I’ll get ahead of myself, for a moment here. These two lines tell git to ignore files that don’t exist yet. I will create those in subsequent steps, so that I never accidentally commit and push them. Those files are useful to me, but I don’t want to:\n commit (potentially large) data sets to the Git repository give the solution to participants.   Step 2. Create an project environment The renv package manages a single environment per R project.\nAs such, for each environment that I want participants to use for a set of exercises, I create a new R project, under the main Git repository, setting up a new renv library for that project.\n In RStudio, create a new project for the environment, directly within the main repository.  Do not use git Use renv   We don’t initialise a new Git repository this time, as all the environments are managed by the main Git repository that we created in step 1.\n Step 3. Write an R script using all relevant packages The renv package is capable of detecting the packages needed to run all the scripts in an R project, usually with a bit of extra help.\nI leverage that feature, writing a script that outlines my own rough version of the code that I expect participants to write; but more importantly this script also contains the statements loading all the packages that I expect participants to use. This allows renv to detect and record all the packages that I load in the script, their own dependencies, and the version of all those packages that I used to run and test that my script actually works without error.\nAs such, participants should not need to install any packages at all; the environment should provide everything they need to write a script equivalent to my own.\n Launch the R project for the environment created at step 2. Create a script called solutions.R, within this project directory. Write code that performs the tasks you expect participants to do themselves, loading all the packages that you expect them to use.  For instance, the simple script below will allow me to create an environment that records the version of ggplot2, cowplot, and their relevant dependencies in the project library used to run the script, so that I can provide a working environment that I have tested myself and that participants can use with confidence.\n Step 4. Record the environment Having saved the script in the environment project at step 3, I then use renv to record the packages and versions that I used to write, and run the script to test the code.\n renv::hydrate() to make sure all the packages that I need are installed renv::clean(), to remove packages that I may have installed in the environment, but that are not used by my script any more.  When prompted, answer “no” to the first question (don’t delete packages from your system R library), answer “yes” to the second question (delete packages in your project library that are not needed to run the script). When including Bioconductor packages in the environment, you can answer “no” to the second question when the only packages suggested for removal are BiocStyle::Biocpkg(\"BiocVersion\") and BiocStyle::Biocpkg(\"BiocManager\").  renv::snapshot() to record the current version of all the packages. renv::status() to check that the environment recorded matches the packages and versions currently installed.  You may need to repeat some of the commands above, as needed, until you are satisfied with your script, the packages installed in your environment, and renv::status() prints the following message:\n* The project is already synchronized with the lockfile.  Step 5. Commit and push Once I am satisfied with the environment, and the script runs in that environment, I am ready to commit the files that define the environment.\n git add ., to stage all the changes (use with care if you’re editing multiple environments simultaneously)  The first time I add files to an environment, this is the list of files that I typically see:\nOn branch master Changes to be committed: (use \u0026quot;git restore --staged \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to unstage) new file: .Rprofile new file: environment1.Rproj new file: renv.lock new file: renv/.gitignore new file: renv/activate.R new file: renv/settings.dcf In particular, the renv.lock file is the one that contains the list of packages and versions in the environment. Other files - .Rprofile and those in the renv/ subdirectory - are used by renv to restore and load the environment in subsequent R sessions.\n git commit -m \"added environment1\", to commit the changes (with an appropriate message). git push, to deploy the new/updated files an online repository I that participants hae access to (e.g. GitHub).   Step 6. Restoring and using the environment Everything is now set for participants to fetch and use those environments.\nFirst, I ask participants to clone the repository that contains the environments. They can clone it anywhere on their system, that is not already a Git repository.\n git clone ..., replacing the dots with the link to the repository where I pushed the files.  Then, for every new environment that I want them to use for an exercise, I ask them to copy (recursively) the subdirectory that corresponds to the environment into their work directory. That is, I ask them to copy the environment as a subdirectoy of the Git repository that they use to store their code for the course. In a Terminal, this would look like the following command:\n cp -r .../environment1 .../course-repository/, replacing dots with the full path to the relevant locations on their system.  Then participants can launch an RStudio session using the ...Rproj file in the copied environment. For instance, in a Finder windows, in this example, click on the environment1.Rproj file to launch RStudio.\nFinally, I ask them to restore the environment, which means installing all the packages that I expect them to use for that session.\n renv::restore(), to restore the environment, allowing renv to install all the packages listed in the renv.lock file (with the appropriate version).   Caveats Ideally, I would argue that it is better to manage one R environment per Git repository, which would itself correspond to one R project. That way, users can clone each individual repository, and carry out exercises in the environment provided by the corresponding repository. Furthermore, users could also fork each original repository, to work and commit their own code for each project, independently.\nHowever, for practical reasons, my approach here is it to manage multiple environments in the same repository, with the following motivations:\n I would rather avoid participants having to clone one repository per day, every day, over the duration of the course. I don’t expect participants to fork, clone, and push in the original repository.  Instead:\n At the start of the course, participants initially set up their own Git repository, where they store all the code they write throughout the course. I want to provide a single “read-only” repository where participants can find the files to recreate the environment Participants can then copy each from the “read-only” repository, to their own repository, restore the environment, set up the input data, and write and commit their own code in their own repository.

For simplicity, type the same name “COVID-19-website”.\nDo not add a README or a license yet, an empty repository will do.\nAdd the GitHub remote to your local clone. The remote name should be \"origin\". The url is shown on your GitHub repository page.\ngit2r::remote_add(name = \u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;git@github.com:kevinrue/COVID-19-website.git\u0026quot;)  Push your local clone to the GitHub remote While git2r::push() does exist, it can raise issues related to the detection of your git credentials. For simplicity, I prefer to push and pull directly from the terminal. To run the command below, the current working directory must be the root of the RStudio project.\ngit push -u origin master  Clone the source data repository as a git submodule git submodule add git@github.com:CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git  Write a notebooks for each webpage Fast-forwarding in time, I updated the template index.Rmd and about.Rmd notebooks, added some notebooks, and updated the _site.yml to include those new pages in the built website.\nNote that _site.yml is also useful to exclude certain subdirectories from the built website. In particular, those include the source data folders cloned as a submodule above.\nI also refactored some recurrent code as child notebooks (see the childs/ subdirectory).\n Build the website When you’re ready, click the “Build Webiste” button in the “Build” panel. This is equivalent to running rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8') at the R console. This generates a _site/ subdirectory in your project, that contains all the files for your website.\nTo visualize your website, open the “index.html” file in this subdirectory.\n Deploy the website After inspecting that your website looks as you intend it, you can deploy it on GitHub Pages. This can be done by pushing the files in the _site/ subdirectory. to a gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository.\nInitially, you need to create an empty gh-pages orphan branch as it does not exist. For this, I generally follow instructions in the bookdown book. Briefly:\n# create a branch named gh-pages and clean up everything git checkout --orphan gh-pages git rm -rf . # create a hidden file .nojekyll touch .nojekyll git add .nojekyll git commit -m\u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push origin gh-pages Then, every time you build your website, you need to push the new website to that branch. To automate this process, I wrote a _deploy.sh script, which I run as bash _deplooy.sh. The script is adapted from … and looks like this.\ngit clone -b gh-pages \\ git@github.com:kevinrue/COVID-19-website.git \\ site-output cd site-output git reset --hard HEAD^ git rm -rf * cp -r ../_site/* ./ git add --all * git commit -m \u0026quot;Update the site\u0026quot; git push -f origin gh-pages cd .. rm -rf site-output Note that this script includes two lines that I do not recommend in general. Namely:\ngit reset --hard HEAD^ git push -f origin gh-pages The first line deletes the previous version of the website from the git history, as if it never happened. The second line overrides the GitHub history to erase that commit it from there as well. I only do this here because my website generates many PNG files in each version of the website. If I didn’t delete the previous version each time, the git history would keep track of every version of every PNG file that I ever generated, making the git clone commands increasingly time consuming each time I clone the gh-pages branch to push a new version of the website.\n Thanks for reading!

Next, we will walk participants through the various components of the graphical user interface (GUI). Finally, we will demonstrate how individual instances of iSEE applications can be preconfigured to save time and share insights with others.\nThroughout the workshop, we will showcase key features of the package that make it a great companion for interactive and reproducible analysis for a variety of genomics data modalities:\n A multi-panel layout to simultaneously visualise multiple aspects of the dataset. Point selections using shiny brushes or lasso polygons drawn by consecutive clicks.  Multiple concurrent selections supported in versions ≥ 1.3.8.  Dynamic linking between plot and table panels, allowing users to transmit information across multiple panels via point selection. Dynamic addition, removal, reordering, and resizing of panels. Automatic tracking, storage, and rendering of the exact R code in a shinyAce editor to allow regeneration of all visible plots in a given application instance. Intelligent density-dependent downsampling of data points shown for large data sets. Custom colour scale specification for individual and groups of discrete and continuous variables. Construction of bespoke interactive guided tours using rintrojs. Dynamic detection of discrete and continuous covariates, switching individual plot panels between scatter plots, violin plots, and “square” plots. Ability for users to programmatically define additional custom panels based on any number of user-defined functions performing on-the-fly calculations. Ability to preconfigure app instances, including point selections and state of collapsible panels, to launch individual app instances in any predefined state. Retrieval of gene annotations on the fly by using either user-defined functions or the built-in annotateEntrez or annotateEnsembl functions. Hands-free control of the app using voice recognition by annyang in versions ≥ 1.3.2.
